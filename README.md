# Modelling the QM9 dataset using Meta-learning and graph neural networks

In this project, we are combining Meta-learning, specifically the MAML algorithm and its variants, and graph neural networks to predict the properties of molecules in the Qm9 dataset. 
The goal of this project is predicting the internal energy of organic molecules with a chemical accuracy (â‰ˆ1 kcal/mol) at a 100 training instances. This would be so low dimensional that we could really analyze it and understand the quantum chemistry behind it.
