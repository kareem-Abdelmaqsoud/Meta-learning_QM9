# Modelling the QM9 dataset using Meta-learning and graph neural networks

The goal of this project is Finding a model that could have a chemical accuracy (â‰ˆ1 kcal/mol) at a 100 training instances. 
This would be so low dimensional that we could really analyze it and understand the quantum chemistry behind it.
